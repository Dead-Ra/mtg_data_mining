# Magic the gathering: Data Mining

I am learning data mining approaches. To practice, I decided to apply them to the card based game called Magic the gathering.
The objective is to realize a recommendation system for assisting players to build cards deck.

At the moment, the approaches integrated into this project are :
  - Latent semantic analysis
  - Association rules
  - Collaborative filtering

The code is developped in Python 3.
