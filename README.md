# Magic the gathering: Data Mining

This is a first project on data mining.
The objective is to implement the concepts that may be used in a recommendation system for assisting players to build cards deck.

At the moment, the approaches integrated into this project are :
  - Latent semantic analysis
  - Association rules
  - Collaborative filtering (item to item)

Each approach has its own folder with the associated source code and a main file. The project does not furnish a well packaged library.
