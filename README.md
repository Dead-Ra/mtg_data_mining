# Magic the gathering: Data Mining

I am learning data mining approaches. To practice, I decided to apply them to the card based game Magic the gathering.
The objective is to realize a recommendation engine for deck building.

At the moment, the approaches integrated into this project are :
  - Identification of frequent items in existing decks
  - Generation of association rules
  - Collaborative filtering

The code is developped in Python 3.
